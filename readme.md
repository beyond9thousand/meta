I am an artist by trade, but I enjoy dabbling in the UNIX philosophy in my spare time. I am also a strong advocate for good but manageable privacy practices. This blog is a collection of all the tools, links, open source programmes, and other useful resources that I either regularly use or think are very helpful.

If you have any suggestions for similar content that I could include in this project, or feedback, please contact me using the links at the bottom of this page.
