### Two-factor authentication apps

Two-factor authentication or '2FA' is an additional layer of security used to ensure that people attempting to access an online account are who they claim to be. A user will first enter their username and password. Instead of gaining immediate access, they will be required to provide additional information. If you are signed up to any private messaging or social media apps, not enabling 2FA is **practically criminal**

### Temporary email services

Use a disposable email address rather than your work or personal account if you are unsure about a new service you are going to sign up for. An added benefit is that you won't have a clogged inbox or risk being added to a list for newsletters and other garbage.
