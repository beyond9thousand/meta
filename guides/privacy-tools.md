### :icon-key: Two-factor authentication apps [!badge variant="danger" text="Critical"]

[Two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication#Mobile_phone-based_authentication) or **2FA** is an additional layer of security used to ensure that people attempting to access an online account are who they claim to be. A user will first enter their username and password. Instead of gaining immediate access, they will be required to provide additional information.

!!!danger
Using private messaging services, including both email and social media without activating 2FA is extremely dangerous. You are practically asking to get **hacked, impersonated and doxxed online.** It is highly advised against turning-off 2FA for convenience purposes.

### :icon-mail: Temporary email services

Use a disposable email address rather than your work or personal account if you are unsure about a new service you are going to sign up for. An added benefit is that you won't have a clogged inbox or risk being added to a list for newsletters and other garbage.
